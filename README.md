# Student Management System 🧑‍🎓

This is a simple Python-based **Student Management System** designed for basic operations such as storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting student information. Data is saved to and loaded from a text file (`students.txt`).

## Features

 - Add new student 
 - Modify student record 
 - Delete student 
 - Find student by student number 
 - Show all students 
 - Show students by year of birth 
 - Save to file / Load from file 
 - Calculates student age automatically

## Technologies

- **Language**: Python 3
- **File I/O**: Reads/Writes `.txt` files
- **Data Format**: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

## How It Works

- A student is represented as an object with the following attributes:
  - Student Number
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Date of Birth
  - Sex
  - Country of Birth
- Student records are stored in a fixed-size list (up to 100 students).
- Data persistence is done through `students.txt`.
